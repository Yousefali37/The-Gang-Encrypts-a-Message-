# The Gang Encrypts a Message 

Welcome to the **The Gang Encrypts a Message**! This is a college project built to showcase the implementation of cryptographic algorithms including RC4, Polyalphabetic, Playfair, and Simplified DES. Designed as a web application, it allows users to encrypt and decrypt text interactively, making cryptography accessible and educational.

## Features  

### 1. **RC4 Encryption**  
   - Encrypt and decrypt text using the fast and efficient RC4 stream cipher.  

### 2. **Polyalphabetic Cipher**  
   - Apply Vigen√®re-based polyalphabetic substitution for secure text encryption.  

### 3. **Playfair Cipher**  
   - Perform digraph substitution using a 5x5 key matrix for unique encryption.  

### 4. **Simplified DES**  
   - Explore a simplified version of the Data Encryption Standard for learning purposes.  

### 5. **Interactive Interface**  
   - Input text, select algorithms, and view results in real-time.  

### 6. **Responsive Design**  
   - Access the application seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.  

### 7. **Key Management**  
   - Easily provide and manage keys for algorithms that require them.
